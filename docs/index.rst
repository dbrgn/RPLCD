Welcome to RPLCD's documentation!

About
=====

RPLCD is a Python 2/3 Raspberry PI Character LCD library for the Hitachi HD44780
controller. It supports both GPIO (parallel) mode as well as boards with an I2C
port expander (e.g. the PCF8574 or the MCP23008).

This library is inspired by Adafruit Industries' CharLCD_ library as well as by
Arduino's LiquidCrystal_ library.

No external dependencies (except the ``RPi.GPIO`` library, which comes
preinstalled on Raspbian) are needed to use this library.


Features
========

**Already implemented**

- Simple to use API
- Support for both 4 bit and 8 bit modes
- Support for both parallel (GPIO) and I²C connection
- Support for custom characters
- Support for backlight control circuits
- Built-in support for `A00` and `A02` character tables
- Python 2/3 compatible
- Caching: Only write characters if they changed
- No external dependencies (except `RPi.GPIO`, and `python-smbus` if you need
  I²C support)

**Wishlist**

These things may get implemented in the future, depending on my free time and
motivation:

- MicroPython port
