### v1.4.0 (2025-03-29)

- [fix] Fix two wrong characters in ST7066-0B charmap (#142)
- [rem] Remove support for Python 2.7
- [rem] Drop support for Python 3.4–3.7

### v1.3.1 (2023-03-25)

- [fix] Check invalid cursor position only when auto_linebreaks enabled (#93, #109)
- [rem] Drop support for Python 3.3
- [dep] This is the last release with official Python 2 and 3.4/3.5/3.6 support

### v1.3.0 (2020-05-03)

This release adds a new charmap (thanks @kroesi) and fixes an initialization
bug when using the pigpio backend (thanks @makslevental).

- [add] Add support for ST7066 0B charmap (#95)
- [fix] pigpio: Fix initialization without `pin_contrast` (#97) 
- [dep] This is the last release with official Python 3.3 support

### v1.2.2 (2019-02-16)

- [fix] Fix packaging bug that would result in the error message `ImportError:
        cannot import name 'codecs'` (#92)

### v1.2.1 (2019-02-14)

Older LCDs (or LCDs that are based off the HD44780) aren't all made equal. It
appears that some don't run at the reference clock, and as such, they're in a
busy state far more often than newer or better ones; this leads to missed
sends.

This release contains a new compatibility mode that increases wait times during
writes. This should fix issues with occasionally garbled display contents. To
enable it, pass `compat_mode=True` to the `CharLCD` constructor.

Thanks @lcheng1 for the fix and @albedozero for testing it!

- [fix] Add compatibility mode (#91, #70)

### v1.2.0 (2018-11-27)

This release adds support for the pure-python `smbus2` library as an automatic
fallback for `smbus` (thanks @joscha) and fixes an issue with the testsuite
(thanks @bazooka07). Last but not least, the `rplcd-tests` script should now be
included as a console script when packaging RPLCD.

- [add] Support smbus2 as drop-in replacement for I2C access (#90)
- [fix] Fix missing global modifier in tests (#88)
- [chg] Bundle test script when packaging (#82)

### v1.1.0 (2018-04-07)

This release primarily includes the pigpio backend (thanks @sphh!) and a few
small improvements. Among other things, you can now use the I²C backend without
having the `RPi.GPIO` library installed!

- [add] Add pigpio backend (#77)
- [chg] Limit GPIO cleanup to active pins (#72)
- [chg] Add better help regarding missing `numbering_mode` (#80)
- [chg] Late-import of GPIO backend in compatibility wrapper (#78)

### v1.0.0 (2017-07-30)

This is the first release that can be considered stable. It involves some API
changes, so you might need to adapt your scripts (mainly because some default
arguments to `CharLCD` were removed).

If you notice any documentation that hasn't been updated yet to the newer API,
please let us know!

- [add] Support for `MCP23008` and `MCP23017` I²C port expanders (#43, #59)
- [add] Add `RPLCD.__version__` attribute
- [fix] Fix bug in auto linebreak algorithm (#53)
- [fix] Fix bugs in show_charmap script (#52)
- [fix] Fix error in A02 character map
- [chg] Remove default args for `gpio.CharLCD`, pins and numbering mode always
        need to be specified explicitly from now on (#60)
- [chg] Remove default for `i2c.CharLCD` i2c_expander parameter,
        always needs to be specified explicitly from now on
- [chg] Remove all enums (`Alignment`, `CursorMode`, `ShiftMode`,
        `BacklightMode`), replace them with string based API (#67)
- [chg] Rewrite test scripts, expose them all through a single entry point
        script: `lcdtest.py` (#58, #59)

### v0.9.0 (2017-05-09)

This version can be considered the release candidate for the 1.0 release.

- [add] Support for `PCF8574` I²C port expander (#20)
- [add] Implement proper automatic encoding of unicode strings,
        add encoding tables for A00 and A02 character maps (#40)
- [add] Implement convenience functions for CR/LF (#45) 
- [add] Add documentation (#37)
- [dep] Deprecate context managers (#18)
- [rem] Drop support for Python 3.2
